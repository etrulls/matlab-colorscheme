% function color_scheme(scheme)
%   Scheme: 'defaults', 'solarized-dark', 'monokai-dark'
%   They are not really those schemes but my approximations
%   The 'defaults' scheme doesn't restore anything, just sets values close
%   to the default ones.
%
%   Ripped off from various sources, tweaked to my liking. Thoroughly
%   undebugged. IT CAN KILL YOU!
%
%   Tested only with R2013a and whatever options I use.
%   If something breaks: restore the defaults on the preference pane.
%   If everything breaks: delete your preferences file (you'll lose stuff)
