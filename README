% function color_scheme(scheme)
%   Scheme: 'defaults', 'solarized-dark', 'monokai-dark'
%   They are not really those schemes but my approximations
%   IMPORTANT: The 'defaults' scheme doesn't actually restore anything,
%   it just sets values close to the default ones! I don't know how to
%   do it properly and I don't care enough. You might!
%
%   Ripped off from various sources, tweaked to my liking. Thoroughly
%   untested. Use it at your own risk.
%
%   Tried it only with R2013a (os x/linux) and whatever options I use.
%   If something breaks: restore the defaults on the preference pane.
%   If everything breaks: you can delete your preferences file (you'll
%   lose stuff!).
